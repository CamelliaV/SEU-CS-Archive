# 1.1.1

What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

​	Compiler is a language processor that translates a program in source language into an equivalent program in target language.

​	Interpreter is a language processor that executes operations in the source program statement by statement.

#1.1.2

What are the advantages of (a) a compiler over an interpreter (b) an interpreter over a compiler?

​	(a) Program produced by a compiler is usually much faster than an interpreter at mapping inputs to outputs.

​	(b) Provide better error diagnostics (as it executes statement by statement);

​		Provide interaction (you may modify some source code during run time);

​		Function partly even if error ever arises.

# 1.1.3

What advantages are there to a language-processing system in which the compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?

​	Easier to produce and debug.

# 1.1.4

A compiler that translates a high-level language into another high-level language is called a source-to-source translator. What advantages are there to using C as a target language for a compiler?

Boost of execution performance.

# 1.1.5

Describe some of the tasks that an assembler needs to perform.

​	Process assembly language program to produce relocatable machine code.
